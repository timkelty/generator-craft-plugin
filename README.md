## Getting Started

To install Yeoman, it's required packages and the generator, run:

```bash
npm install -g yo bower grunt-cli gulp generator-craft-plugin
```

Finally, initiate the generator. You'll probably want to do this in the root of your Craft project, but the generator will ask you where to put things:

```bash
yo craft-plugin
```
